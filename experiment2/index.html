				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h4>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</h4>
				<p>We are trying to make a generator from a landscape picture.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<h4>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</h4>
				<p>We used perlin noise in p5.js and my partner created a new perlin noise function in order to make some of the mountains. I added in the moving sphere and cacti with the sphere moving in an arc based on a sin function and curves to make sure that it doesn't overlap with any of the mountains. The mountains and cacti will change positions when pressed with the mouse and makes the generation a lot easier than just pressing the reload page over and over again.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<h4>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</h4>
				<p>I found moving the sphere to be the most difficult part of the project to work on and trying to make sure that the arc worked and moved the way that I wanted it to took a while even with Desmos and GPT to help me. Otherwise, the random generation was easy and not really difficult to do or implement.</p>
