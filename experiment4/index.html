				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h4>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</h4>
				<p>For this experiment, we are trying to create a simple text generator similar to a Mab Libs. This one is supposed to generate an online recipt similar to one you would find from Amazon.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<h4>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</h4>
				<p>I added in JS and functionality for the buttons with flags to set the buttons hidden. After clicking the buttons, they should generate the result with either the default option or the Fisher yates option with you either choosing the top of the options or the bottom of it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<h4>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</h4>
				<p>This project was easy going but I did have difficulties with trying to get the buttons to work as I haven't done buttons in javascript and I had to make sure that the buttons were hidden when clicking the other ones which took a while to get the correct flags. 
				I found the algorithm for the Fisher-Yates Shuffle to be interesting and I wished that there would more shuffling algorithms we could look at besides just this one. Another difficulty was to get the spacing of the lines correct and I had to search stackoverflow for the solution as it had to with JQuery and how it dealt with text.</p>
